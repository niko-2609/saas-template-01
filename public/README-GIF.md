# Adding Your Feature Demo GIF

To showcase your main feature on the landing page, follow these simple steps:

1. Prepare your GIF file:
   - Create a high-quality GIF that demonstrates your main feature
   - Optimize the GIF for web (keep file size reasonable, ideally under 5MB)
   - Recommended dimensions: 1280x720 or 16:9 aspect ratio

2. Add the GIF to the public folder:
   - Name your GIF file `demo-feature.gif`
   - Place it directly in the `/public` folder of your project
   - The full path should be: `/public/demo-feature.gif`

3. That's it! The GIF will automatically appear on your landing page.

## Optimization Tips

- Use a tool like [EZGif](https://ezgif.com/optimize) or [Compressor.io](https://compressor.io/) to optimize your GIF
- Consider using a video format (MP4/WebM) for better performance if your GIF is large
- Ensure the GIF clearly demonstrates your product's value proposition

## Troubleshooting

If your GIF doesn't appear:
- Verify the file is named exactly `demo-feature.gif`
- Check that it's placed directly in the `/public` folder
- Restart your development server
- Clear your browser cache
